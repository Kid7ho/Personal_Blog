                    <p class = "section">Personal Blog</p>
                    <p>Welcome to my personal blog. This is a place where I post everything I've studied and everything I've developed. Since 8th Grade, I've decided to become <strong>Computer Programmer</strong>. Since then, I have been studying many computer languages such as C, C#, Java, Python, and etc, and with the languages I have studied, I developed lots of applications.</p>
                    <p>At one point, I realized that everything I made or studied are all spreaded apart. Some data are stored in my old laptop, some data are stored in my cloud storage, and some important data just disappeared. So with the knowledge I learned from my 'Internet Programming' class, I decided to make my own developer blog from scratch and store everything as articles on the blog. By moving every data to this website, this personal blog can not only work as a huge storage, but also can serve as my <strong>Portfolio</strong>. Not only that, this website itself can prove my confidence in using Website Computer Languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>So from now on, I will start posting everything I have about <strong>Computer Science</strong> and this will be my <span class = "red bold">Assembly of My Computer Science Career</span>.</p>
